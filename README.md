# RCTool
RCTool consists of two components, i.e., a modeler and an analyzer.
1) The modeler is implemented on the open-source Petri tool PIPE (Platform Independent Petri net Editor) , which can help emergency organizations visually model their response processes. The output of the modeler is a PNML file extended with initial markings, final markings, message places, labels, resource places, and uncertain firing delays. Figure 11 shows the emergency response processes in FMR modeled by the modeler.
